	<h1>Kiln popup</h1>
	<p>Mouse over the box below. The popup bubble should always remain within the box,
		and the arrow be pointing in one of the eight compass directions.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test1"></div>

	<p>This tests the behaviour when there is a lot of text in the popup. When the mouse is near
		the middle of the box, the bubble cannot be accommodated completely within it. The arrow
		should again always point in one of the eight compass directions, and the bubble should
		never overlap the box horizontally, only vertically.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test2"></div>

	<p>This tests the behaviour when there is so much text in the popup that it cannot be accommodated
		within the container at all. In this case the box should protrude outside the box vertically
		but not horizontally, and the arrow should slide along the edges of the box to fit it in as well
		as possible.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test3"></div>

	<p>This is the same as the previous test, except that the box should protrude horizontally but
		not vertically.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test4"></div>

	<p>This popup box should always point upwards.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test5"></div>

	<p>This popup box should always point to the right.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test6"></div>

	<p>This popup box should always point down.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test7"></div>

	<p>This popup box should always point left.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test8"></div>

	<p>This popup box should point right or left.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test9"></div>

	<p>This popup should point within the smaller box.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test10">
		<div class="inner"></div>
	</div>

	<p>This popup should have a black background and white text.</p>
	<div class="test" id="test11"></div>

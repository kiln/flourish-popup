# 2.1.0

* Add option to use an array for point method

# 2.0.1

* Minor improvements to code clarity, again in the fix for #16. Should have no effect on behaviour.

# 2.0.0

* More robust fix for #16. The major version number has been bumped, because this is technically a breaking change since it changes the DOM structure. It is unlikely to break anything in practice, if you have used CSS of the form suggested by the documentation.

# 1.2.1

* Prevent popups at the edge of the document from making the document scrollable. #16
